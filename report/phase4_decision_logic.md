Design irrigation and fertilization rules for a Smart Agriculture system.

CONTEXT:
- Mediterranean climate (hot, dry summers)
- Crops: tomatoes (primary focus)
- Soil type: loamy soil (typical water retention)
- Available sensors: soil moisture (%), temperature (°C), humidity (%)

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Irrigation rules should consider:
   - Soil moisture levels
   - Current temperature
   - Humidity
   - Historical trends
   
2. Fertilization rules should consider:
   - Time since last fertilization
   - Crop growth stage
   - Soil moisture (nutrients absorbed better in moist soil)

3. Each rule must include:
   - Trigger conditions
   - Recommended action
   - Human-readable explanation
   - Agronomic justification

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide rules in structured format with thresholds, conditions, and explanations.
