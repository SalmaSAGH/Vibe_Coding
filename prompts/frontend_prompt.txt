You are a senior frontend engineer specializing in data dashboards
and human-centered interfaces for decision support systems.

Design and generate a Streamlit-based web dashboard for a
Smart Agriculture Decision Support System.

CONTEXT
The frontend consumes a REST API (FastAPI backend) that provides:
- Current sensor readings (soil moisture, temperature, humidity)
- Historical sensor data
- Irrigation and fertilization recommendations
- Alert messages (drought, overwatering, temperature stress)

The target users are farmers and agricultural technicians
with limited technical background.

TECHNOLOGY CONSTRAINTS
- Language: Python
- Framework: Streamlit
- Visualization: Plotly
- Communication with backend via HTTP (requests library)
- No authentication required for this prototype

API ENDPOINTS AVAILABLE
- GET /api/sensors/list
- GET /api/sensors/current/{sensor_id}
- GET /api/sensors/history/{sensor_id}?limit=N
- GET /api/recommendations/{sensor_id}
- POST /api/sensors/data

UI REQUIREMENTS

1. Global Layout
- Wide layout with sidebar navigation
- Clear title and agricultural visual identity
- Custom CSS for visual clarity and usability

2. Sidebar
- Sensor selection dropdown
- Page navigation with multiple views:
  - Dashboard
  - Historical Data
  - Add Sensor Data
  - About
- Optional auto-refresh capability

3. Dashboard Page
- Display current sensor values using visual gauges
  - Soil moisture (%)
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Humidity (%)
- Highlight optimal ranges visually
- Display last update timestamp

4. Recommendations Section
- Fetch recommendations from the backend
- Display irrigation recommendations:
  - Action
  - Water amount
  - Priority
  - Explanation
- Display fertilization recommendations with explanations

5. Alerts Visualization
- Display alerts prominently
- Use color coding to distinguish:
  - Critical alerts (e.g., drought risk)
  - Warning alerts (e.g., overwatering risk)

6. Historical Data Page
- Display time-series charts for:
  - Soil moisture
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
- Interactive Plotly charts
- Display raw data table and basic statistics

7. Add Sensor Data Page
- Form allowing manual submission of sensor data
- Input validation for realistic ranges
- Confirmation feedback on successful submission

8. About Page
- Describe system purpose and features
- Explain how to use the dashboard
- List technology stack

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- Interface must be intuitive and readable
- Avoid information overload
- Use visual cues instead of technical jargon
- Code should be modular and well-commented

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Provide a single Streamlit application file (app.py)
- Include helper functions for API calls
- Use Plotly for charts and gauges
- Include basic error handling for API failures
